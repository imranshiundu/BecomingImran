# Becoming Imran â€” One-Page PWA Link Hub (Black & White)

## How to use
- Replace social links in **index.html** (#links section).
- Replace Portfolio URL (currently https://example.com).
- Drop your actual QR image inside the `.qr-box` or replace that div with an <img> tag.
- (Optional) Replace the SVG mark in the header with your provided logo image.

## Deploy
- Host at the site root (Netlify recommended). Ensure these files are at the project root:
  - index.html, styles.css, app.js, manifest.webmanifest, service-worker.js
- Netlify will serve `/` correctly. PWA will prompt for install after first visit.

## Theme
- Black/white only. Dark mode toggle persists in localStorage.
- iOS-inspired rounded, glass, and smooth reveal animations.

## Contact buttons
- WhatsApp links use your numbers provided.
- Email uses imranshiundu@gmail.com with a subject prefilled.

Enjoy!
